I'm currently studying Python for data science, focusing on analysis and visualization. Feel free to check out the `README.md` or `.ipynb` files to review my notes. Some are written in Chinese, some in English, and occasionally a mix of both. I donâ€™t plan to reorganize or rewrite them, but you should still be able to understand them.

Here are my suggested resources: <br>
[Build Models](https://github.com/Teqden/python-datascience-notes/blob/main/notes/self-study/) <br>
[Functions Usage](https://github.com/Teqden/python-datascience-notes/blob/main/notes/practical-usage/README.md) <br>
[Data Science Theory](https://github.com/Teqden/python-datascience-notes/blob/main/notes/theory-knowledge/README.md) <br>
[Quiz & Excerise](https://github.com/Teqden/python-datascience-notes/blob/main/notes/theory-knowledge/excerise/README.md)
