                        <h2>Goal & Plan</h2>
                        <p class="subTitle">During my Studies</p>
                        <p>As I embark on my academic journey, there are specific areas to which I am wholeheartedly committed.</p>
                        <p>First and foremost, I am dedicated to the continual growth and refinement of my coding skills. I recognize that coding is much like acquiring a new language - the more you practice, the more proficient you become. As such, I am resolute in dedicating a substantial amount of time to coding practice, continually pushing myself to enhance my proficiency in this field.</p>
                        <p>However, my pursuit of knowledge within Information and Communication Technology (ICT) extends beyond textbooks and computers; it offers a unique opportunity for building connections. I plan to actively participate in clubs and groups related to coding and other interests of mine. These forums will provide an ideal platform for me to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passions, fostering new friendships and opportunities for collaboration.</p>
                        <p>Equally important is the maintenance of my physical and mental well-being. I intend to prioritize a balanced lifestyle that encompasses proper nutrition, adequate rest, and regular physical activity. This commitment not only benefits my body but also enhances cognitive function, ultimately facilitating better learning and concentration. I might even explore the possibility of joining a sports team or a fitness group to inject enjoyment into my journey towards health and well-being.</p>
                        <p class="subTitle">After Graduation</p>
                        <p>OUpon the culmination of my studies and the attainment of my degree, I harbor ambitious aspirations that I am eager to pursue.</p>
                        <p>One of these aspirations is to craft an exceptional application, whether it takes the form of an engaging mobile app or a sophisticated computer program. The process of building an application from the ground up is akin to sculpting a unique masterpiece, commencing with raw ingredients and transforming them into something extraordinary. While this endeavor may appear formidable, I view it as a progressive puzzle, where I will acquire knowledge step by step, starting with designing the user interface and progressing towards ensuring seamless functionality. The thrill lies in the prospect of creating something valuable that people can utilize and appreciate, be it an entertaining game or a practical tool.</p>
                        <p>What's even more exhilarating is my desire to secure a fulfilling job in this field, allowing me to be an integral part of a team that utilizes technology to positively impact the world. This path will enable me to leverage my acquired skills to work on exciting projects while earning a livelihood in a profession about which I am deeply passionate. An essential facet of my plan is a commitment to continued learning. Technology exists in a constant state of flux, and I am dedicated to staying up-to-date and enhancing my skills to remain relevant in the dynamic tech landscape. Much like a young athlete striving to become a sports star, I will wholeheartedly dedicate myself to studying and practicing diligently. I will also actively seek out opportunities to connect with mentors and fellow tech enthusiasts who can provide guidance on this journey.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, my plan extends beyond the realm of work. I place great value on leisure and relaxation, such as enjoying games and spending quality time with friends and family. Striking a harmonious balance between work and recreation is akin to ensuring that my character in a game has sufficient energy for all the adventures that lie ahead. Therefore, post-graduation, I will embark on a mission to develop exceptional applications and pursue a fulfilling career within the tech industry.</p>
