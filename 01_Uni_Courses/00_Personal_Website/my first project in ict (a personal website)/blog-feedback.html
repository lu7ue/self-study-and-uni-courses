                        <h2>Feedback(SKC)</h2>
                        <p>Welcome Luyue Zhang,</p>
                        <p>Reading your motivation, itâ€™s nice to see you already have fun ideas you wish to turn into
                            reality by learning more about programming. But in order to survive the full study program I
                            encourage you to ask yourself and search for a bigger motivation, something that will push
                            you forward when the studies become difficult, what will keep you going and not quitting
                            this program.</p>
                        <p>You can ask yourself why you want to make these ideas reality? Why the other work you had did
                            not give you the right amount of satisfaction that maybe this career will? To help give you
                            more ideas of the opportunities or roles you could do after completing your studies I
                            recommend you do small research and check different roles, companies, and descriptions. See
                            what interests you more or less and why, this will help keep you focused and may even help
                            with your motivation as well.</p>
                        <p>It is good to see you are interested in some of the things you will be studying and
                            practicing here at HZ but check which rules in the future will allow you to do them too.
                            Also, I recommend you attend next year the ICT conference, there you can speak to companies
                            and learn more about what they do, who they are searching for and so on.</p>
                        <p>It seems that you are aware of your strengths and weaknesses, and this is very important, it
                            will help you prepare for your studies and handle difficult situations.</p>
                        <p>It is very good you are serious and hardworking but pay attention to not always expect
                            perfection of your work because it may tire you or sometimes will be impossible, prepare
                            yourself that not always the outcome will be exactly what you wish it to be and that is
                            okay.</p>
                        <p>It is also great you are good at scheduling and handling time, don't forget to also schedule
                            breaks and fun activities for yourself.</p>
                        <p>Maybe check with yourself what may help you when you find yourself overthinking or worrying
                            about small details, what can prevent you from spending too much time on something.</p>
                        <p>And regards to mathematics, it scared me too at first, but this program does not enter to
                            advanced mathematics, and you can always take extra courses online to better your level if
                            you shall need and want it, so please do not worry!</p>
                        <p>I am looking forward to meeting you this coming year and wish you a lovely summer break!</p>
                        <p>Shirel.</p>
